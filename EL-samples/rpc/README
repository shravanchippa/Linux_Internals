/* README file for the RPC programs */
Sources
-------
	(1) avg.x
	(2) avgclient.c  
	(3) avgserver.c
	(4) Makefile

From command line by issuing the command
# rpcgen  avg.x

This will create 4 files 
    avg.h     : the header file which need to be included in our 
                server and client programs.
    avg_clnt.c: the stub program for our client process.
    avg_svc.c : the main program for our server process.
    avg_xdr.c : the XDR routines used by both the client and the server.

step 1
-------
  Run the Makefile from command prompt by giving 'make' in the 
command prompt which will create all the files required for the 
client and server programs and provide you with two executables.


step 2
-------
First test the client and the server on the same machine. 
Start the server by entering the command:

# avgserver &  ( this will run the server program in background )

The rpcinfo utility can be used to verify that the server is running. 
Typing the command:

# rpcinfo -p 

gives the following output:

	program vers proto   port
	100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
 	100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
	 22855    1   udp   1221
	 22855    1   tcp   1223


 Here 22855 is the program number of our application from avg.x and 
the version number is 1. Edit the "/etc/rpc" file and add the following 
line to it:
avg        22855

rpcinfo -p command then gives the following output:

	program vers proto   port
	100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
	100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
	22855     1   udp   1221  avg
	22855     1   tcp   1223  avg

step 3
-------
To test the client application issue from command line

# avgclient  localhost 6 4 2

the output will be the three numbers and the average of the three.

value   = 6.000000
value   = 4.000000
value   = 2.000000
average = 4.000000

step 4
-------
To run the same programs in two different systems. Copy the server 
executable to remote system and run it, Run the client program from
your system where use the ipaddress of the remote system instead of 
local host.
